# Flood Monitoring in Nanda Bet

A series of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to monitor flooding using Sentinel-1 and CYGNSS in the Little Rann of Kachchh (LRK), Gujarat, India, centered on the small island of Nanda Bet. 

## About the Nanda Bet Flood Monitoring Project
Nanda Bet is one of 74 islands in the saline desert of LRK. During monsoon season, the regions fills with water and becomes a wetland.

These scripts use Sentinel-1 and CYGNSS to observe changes in surface water extent in and around Nanda Bet, but can be adapted for any region by modifying the region of interest (roi) parameters, date ranges, and optimizing thresholds for local soil types, vegetation, etc.
